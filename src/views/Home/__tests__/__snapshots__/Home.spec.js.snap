        About me
      </styled.h2>
      <styled.p>
        My journey on the web began in the mid 90’s when my dad brought our first computer home. I remember the total awe I experienced when I realised how many creative things you could do with it! You could draw (pixel by pixel), make simple computer games and eventually a friend’s dad bought a digital camera and we made a first person adventure game by taking photos and you would navigate from scene to scene by clicking different areas of the picture.
      </styled.p>
      <styled.p>
        I came across Adobe Photoshop and my imagination went wild. It didn’t take long before I wanted to make my own website. I wrote novels, I made digital graphics, I took pictures and a website was the obvious place to show those things off to the world. So I began my early days in web development with WYSIWYG-tools (What-you-see-is-what-you-get) like Front Page 2000 and later on Macromedia Dreamweaver (later bought up by Adobe).
      </styled.p>
      <styled.p>
        Gradually I learned XHTML and CSS and to copy-paste simple JavaScript snippets. Time passed by, I percieved programming to be some sort of mathematical wizardry that was way beyond my reach so I stayed focused on Photoshop, photo manipulation, retouching, designing web sites but only doing the HTML/CSS parts, while using WordPress themes to bend into shape with pure will and a lot of frustration (from helpful friends).
      </styled.p>
      <styled.p>
        Eventually I started to get a grasp on PHP but still, that programming stuff seemed too hard. Or was it? I found really good tutorials on YouTube and gradually I learned more and more. At some point I decided I needed to try it out for real, so hesitant but curious I applied to university to study two years of Web Development. It was so much fun!
      </styled.p>
      <styled.p>
        Since then I have been working as a web developer. I started out with PHP but lately I have spent almost all my time in JavaScript building Single Page Applications with React and mobile apps with React Native for projects with tens of thousands of users.

        What drives me (or why I go to work)
      </Styled(styled.h3)>
      <styled.p>
        To me, web development is about solving practial problems by building tools for users, i.e. “real people” and having fun. Nothing is worth it in the long run, if you can’t have fun while doing it, right?
      </styled.p>
      <styled.p>
        I’m not particularly set in my views of how to solve problems and overcome obstacles. Programming languages and frameworks change over time, especially in web development, and while being a nerd for technical stuff, the fun to me is not only in the technical aspects of development, but in the shared experience and the intellectual gains from working with really talented and smart people in this achievement, towards a common goal.
      </styled.p>
      <styled.p>
        I love learning new things, be it group-psychology to help a team work better together, a new way of organising components in UI design, or learning about different aspects of databases and why you should pick
        <em>
          Redis
        </em>
         in one case or perhaps 
        <em>
          Postgres
        </em>
         in another.
      </styled.p>
      <styled.p>
        I have a wide experience and I’m not an expert in any one single field. I’m a web designer gone web developer, mostly focused on frontend but I can put up an API (REST or GraphQL) and build authentication with Express, Passport and JWT if needed. My main contribution though, I would say, is providing alternative point of views with my sometimes unorthordox thinking and curiosity for almost everything I engage myself to. I also care for the people I work with and people seem to confide in me, be it strangers on the bus or colleages. My background of not always being a programmer and enthusiasm for teaching, means I’m able to translate “tech speech” to “normal people”, like clients and business people.
      </styled.p>
      <styled.p>
        People have told me they appreciate me for my honesty and openness, my enthusiasm and energy and the way I provide a different point of view in discussions.
