        About me
      </styled.h2>
      <styled.p>
        As a kid I dreamed of being an inventor, creating really cool machines and find solutions to problems people couldn’t imagine.
      </styled.p>
      <styled.p>
        I grew up, someone made the Internet and I eventually became a web developer.
      </styled.p>
      <styled.p>
        Now I work with teams building awesome web applications and find really cool solutions to problems most people can’t imagine! ;)
