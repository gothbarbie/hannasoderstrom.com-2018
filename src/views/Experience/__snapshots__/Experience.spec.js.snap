          Culture, value and fun is the keywords for Iteam, where I work as a Web Developer. We work in an agile manner, in self-organising teams and in close relationship with our clients, to bring them value. Not only with technology, but with culture as well. Our core values - to produce value, to have fun and to do good - influence not only our daily work, but the clients we take on, the projects we choose to be a part of and therefore also the dedication and eagerness with which we produce really great results for a wide range of businesses.

          I worked in the Studio team, a group with a wide range of skills doing everything from producing ads and new creative mobile ad formats to optimising ads from other medias for the mobile platform.

        <styled.p>
          We worked daily with very short deadlines, 100% performance accountability and served the greatest brands there is, our ads shown to millions of people daily and on the most saught after ad-spots. We focused not only on making ads seen but also to be engaging and fun with all the tools and sensors of modern mobile phones at our disposal.

          Since the mobile web depends on small sized content, we used mainly vanilla JavaScript with few additional tools unless we could build them ourselves.
